                rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Limits:</strong> Unless stated, rewards are non-transferable, have no cash value, and may
                expire.</li>
            <li><strong>Abuse:</strong> Bonus abuse, multi-accounting, or use of bots/automation will void participation
                and may lead to account closure.</li>
            <li><strong>Changes:</strong> We may modify, pause, or cancel a Campaign where necessary (e.g., fraud,
                technical issues, legal requirements).</li>
        </ul>
